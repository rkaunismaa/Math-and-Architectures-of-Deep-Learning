# Math-and-Architectures-of-Deep-Learning

This will be my walk through of the book [Math and Architectures of Deep Learning](https://github.com/krishnonwork/mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning-ipython) by Krishnendu Chaudhury

I created the conda environment 'maaodl' for this task. 

*** mamba activate maaodl ***
